I built an app that will help managers enter team information.  You do this all from the command line, using inqurier and node.  At first, the manager will be prompted to enter their information.
After that, they will be prompted to choose either "engineer" or "intern".  Once chosen, they will add the information for that employee and keep adding until they have entered the entire
team.  After that, an HTML file will generate with all of the team information on it!  Pretty cool! I do want to note that I have been having a very hard time with Node, I got help writing this code and 
a tutor session helped me complete it and put it all together on Friday night.  I still need to learn how to run tests, one I am more comforable with that - I will add them to this project.
I also had a HUGE issue with GitHub, I had to make 5 new repos (I deleted some of them, but kept some of them in GitHub so you can go check out what happened if you want)  I kept pushing my code and it was pushing everything from my "challenges" directory into it, so I had someone from BCS help me fix that.
That is why, you will only see  a few repos.  I kept working on it until I could receive help on the GitHub issue.  Kevin also gave us starter code for this project, which is why it will be similar
to other classmates code.

I'm just happy I got it to run :)
